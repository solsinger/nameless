Hello and welcome to The Project(TM)!

The goal of this fork is to optimize CoffeeMUD 5.9 as of 9/9/2022. This will include rewriting the mudgrinder (some day.) 
For now, it means refactoring code to reduce redundancy and increase visibility into the mud engine.

Known issues to address:
MUDGRINDER
- Design is clunky and unattractive
- The area builder is less than optimal once an area gets to a certain size
- Lacking a character level interface for non-admins
- Outdated technologies (by design) which does not suit someone like myself

RACES
- Races do not utilize extension properly. All races have a copy of "health text," which is rarely unique.
- Health text is not a switch statement, like it should be.
- There is no architecture to allow for inheriting natural weapons based on race type because nobody made a "birdofprey.java" to extend, which will declutter things.
- Body parts can be inherited from master racial profiles, as well.
- Other inheritance "stuff." It's a long list, folks, and it only takes a weekend to fix it at the most. :)
