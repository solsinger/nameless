Hello and welcome to The Project(TM)!

The goal of this fork is to optimize CoffeeMUD 5.9 as of 9/9/2022. This will include rewriting the mudgrinder (some day.) 
For now, it means refactoring code to reduce redundancy and increase visibility into the mud engine.

Known issues to address:
SIPLET
- Begging for a complete redesign to go with the new MudGrinder

MUDGRINDER
- Design is clunky and unattractive
- The area builder is less than optimal once an area gets to a certain size
- Lacking a character level interface for non-admins
- Outdated technologies (by design) which does not suit someone like myself
- Integrate a wiki, possibly made from scratch. This is the new HELP system, even in-game.
- Integrate the posts to public journals and things so they can be read while not logged in.
- Allow character management without being logged in to play. 
--- Allow delete/sell of inventory.
--- Allow house/office space management with builder interface like admin/builder sees.
--- Allow account management.
--- Show last login dates for all characters.
--- Keep all characters on a single account viable instead of auto-deleting.
--- Allow note-taking that is private so that each character's IC information can be documented for player use.
--- Allow personal description management.
--- Allow equipment changes.
--- Allow alias management at character level, along w/ copy to other characters on same account.

FAKEDB
- Replace with real DB & better instructions for installation.

INSTRUCTIONS
- Complete rewrite. (Well, maybe not complete... there's some good humor in there.)

COFFEEMUD.INI
- Super CLUNKY! Chop up into multiple INI files to reduce confusion. Name them suitably to reduce confusion.

RACES
- Races do not utilize extension properly. All races have a copy of "health text," which is rarely unique.
- Health text is not a switch statement, like it should be.
- There is no architecture to allow for inheriting natural weapons based on race type because nobody made a "birdofprey.java" to extend, which will declutter things.
- Body parts can be inherited from master racial profiles, as well.
- Other inheritance "stuff." It's a long list, folks, and it only takes a weekend to fix it at the most. :)

CLASSES
- I think there are too many for my own taste, so reduce. Maybe even go classless.

NEW ADDITIONS
- Quote of the Day at login :)
- Variable text to user at logout :)
