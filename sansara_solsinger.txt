Hello and welcome to The Project(TM)!

The goal of this fork is to optimize CoffeeMUD 5.9 as of 9/9/2022. This will include rewriting the mudgrinder (some day.) 
For now, it means refactoring code to reduce redundancy and increase visibility into the mud engine.

Known issues to address:

- server design that's setup for intermittent networking to take into account phone users.
  Programmer observation:
  I think they mostly aren't great. Especially since network connections on mobile devices are transient.
  And an app in the background must be prepared to suspend at any time.
  Telnet doesn't really work well with that.
  
- SMTP server:
  check if CoffeeMUD servers setup reverse DNS and have TLS certificates.
  (as without that, your SMTP server is likely to be marked as spam or just rejected outright)
  Not even getting into adding DKIM too.
  Running a mail server sucks now.

SIPLET
- Begging for a complete redesign to go with the new MudGrinder

MUDGRINDER
- Design is clunky and unattractive
- The area builder is less than optimal once an area gets to a certain size
- Outdated technologies (by design) which does not suit someone like myself

- Integrate a wiki, possibly made from scratch. This is the new HELP system, even in-game.
- Integrate the posts to public journals and things so they can be read while not logged in (forum).
- Integrate bug tracking, idea tracking, release notes, et cetera, to be very robust.
- Email verification for accounts. Eliminate non-account interface.

- Roles & privileges manager. Default roles: owner, admin, contributor, player.
--- Privileges: builder, help-keeper, storyteller (forum), social manager, admin manager,
--- Default for owner: everything, cannot be revoked no matter how hard you try.
--- Default for admin: builder, help-keeper, storyteller, story-tagging, account-manager. 
------ Must earn social manager by being diligent. PCs have no privileges, only named admins.
--- Default for player: character-builder, character-manager, account-manager, notes-manager, forum-contributor (per character).
------ Force account name to be different than first user name. Allow user to redo account name on creation to use original name as first character.
--- Add ability to design classes for those who will use the engine and demand on having classes.
--- Add ability to design species for those who will use the engine and demand on having their own species.
--- Rename Archon to STAFFER.

- Lacking a character level interface for non-admins
- Allow character management without being logged in to play. 
--- Allow delete/sell of inventory.
--- Allow house/office space management with builder interface like admin/builder sees.
--- Allow account management.
--- Show last game play login dates/times for all characters.
--- Keep all characters on a single account viable instead of auto-deleting.
--- Allow note-taking that is private so that each character's IC information can be documented for player use.
--- Allow personal description management.
--- Allow equipment changes.
--- Allow alias management at character level, along w/ copy to other characters on same account.
--- Allow player to delete/create new characters.
--- Implement soft-delete system; only truly delete the character after 336 hours (two weeks.) I cannot tell you how many times I undeleted idiots.

FAKEDB
- Replace with real DB & better instructions for installation.

INSTRUCTIONS
- Complete rewrite. (Well, maybe not complete... there's some good humor in there.)

AI VOICE & SOUNDS
- Blind community loves text-based gaming but Jabber is so impersonal. Create AI voice to read everything.
- Redo sound integration so you don't need a PhD in rocket science to build a damn game.

COFFEEMUD.INI
- Super CLUNKY! Chop up into multiple INI files to reduce confusion. Name them suitably to reduce confusion.
- Make a folder to hold all the INI files since there will be more than a few.

AREAS, BUILDING, OBJECTS, ETC.
- Update to use JSON or DB storage; destroy XML completely, it's inefficient and stupid.
- Create GUID that is short and sweet (non-user-readable) and link to reference of area name.
- Go back to the way VNUMs used to be, except you don't have to declare how many vnums are in an area. GUID takes care of that.
- Go back to updating an object at its source/root instead of one instance of the object in room A and having a separate object in room B just because you updated it after initial creation & reuse. Loki being a lazy builder doesn't mean it should work that way, sorry bro.
- Implement object decay just like old MUDs... hello, RAM hogger. Optional in INI, default ON.
- Do not allow PC bodies to decay until much later, releasing their objects to the ground with a tag of the PC's name because no more PK BS to steal people's shit. Optional in INI. Default ON.
- Implement PK system where every player kill requires an explanation to the staff. Optional in INI. Default OFF.
- Implement PK points where you permanently die upon reaching 0. No more pissing people off without consequences. Optional in INI. Default OFF.
- Allow owner to indicate # of PK points at character creation. Address what happens if this is expanded or contracted after character is created.
- Reduce to six exit types. It's for the blind, folks!
- Create useful pre-programmed AIs for NPCs, make them easy to customize!
- Locales... implement extension/tree approach.
- Vehicles... make them more intuitive and give them flavoring for sci-fi. (Hello, MECHA! Hello, SPACE SHIPS!)
- Auto-create areas -- skip the room descriptions, they're just cloned anyway. Nobody gives a shit about cloned room descriptions. NOBODY.
- Fix in the sky so you can actually return to the room you started flying from. This always bothered me... do you think a flying critter can't figure out where to land?! If you don't know what I mean, fly up three times, then down three times. You will not be where you started.

SPECIES
- Species... implement resource gathering extension.
- Species do not utilize extension properly. All species have a copy of "health text," which is rarely unique.
- Health text is not a switch statement, like it should be.
- There is no architecture to allow for inheriting natural weapons based on species type because nobody made a "birdofprey.java" to extend, which will declutter things.
- Body parts can be inherited from master species profiles, as well.
- Other inheritance "stuff." It's a long list, folks, and it only takes a weekend to fix it at the most. :)
- Toy with going species-less and allowing players to define the wear locations of their character as they see fit. (doesn't mean they get things to wear there that do stuff, just that they can customize as they please... will bring about massive declutter.)

CLASSES
- I think there are too many for my own taste, so reduce. Maybe even go truly classless.
- Consider "class packages" that characters buy with a point-buy system like Realms of Discordia back in the day.
----- 40 points minimum, 60 points maximum. The points chosen increase the amount of experience it takes to get to the next level.
----- each extra point is 1% increase in XP required for each level. This only matters in a system with Training Points/Skill Points, however.
- Truly remove cross-classing, it's pointless for a classless game.
- Redo skills to de-clutter; having 'everything and the kitchen sink' just makes it impossible to make decisions, esp. if the mud goes to level 999.
- Fix ability extension for those who want it all anyway. :[ clutter-mongers that you are!
- Make crafting a right instead of a privilege.
- Allow skills to be picked up simply by trying! :)
- Get rid of training points/skill points.
----- You build your character the way you want to... but beware... abilities will degrade over time (even if you aren't logged in)
----- Gets rid of people who leave for ages, forget how to play, then return to the game and act like a machismo asshole to trump some noob.
----- Try it when you have no skills left, children!
- Remove spamming related to ability usage. TY, says the blind community!

DISEASES
- Redo for real diseases, like STDs. Watch the MUD go nuts! :D

NEW ADDITIONS
- Quote of the Day at login :)
- Variable text to user at logout :)
- Visualizer that turns text into 2D art in browser for people who don't like to READ. (SHAME ON YOU.)
- Create player-run governments and hierarchies.
